# Voting system simulator

This is a voting system simulator intended to simulate various methods used in proportional voting systems, in particular those that use a biproportional apportionment method for allocation of adjustment seats based on national outcomes. Such systems are common, such as in Iceland, Sweden, and Norway.

[M.L. Balinski and G. Demange][1] have shown that only one method, the Alternating-Scaling method, exists that upholds the five axioms for proportionality in matrices. All other methods are heuristic simplifications that approach the optimal solution to varying degrees. This software implements the Alternating-Scaling method, and various other methods for comparison, and provides mechanisms to compare them.

Biproportional allocation on matrices is a common issue that arises when you have multiple parties in multiple constituencies vying for a set number of seats which are pinned to different constituencies. The goal is to determine which parties get which seats in which constituencies.

More generally this approach could be used to allocate limited resources to factories depending on their relative importance or needs, or to solve a number of other biproportional optimization problems.


## Installation for use with browser interface

1. Make sure Python ≥ 3.9, pip and npm are available
    for example for npm:
      brew install node
2. [OPTIONAL] Create a new Python3 Virtualenv, e.g. 'voting', and enter it.
    for example:  
      conda create --name voting
      conda activate voting
3. Clone this repository
    for example:
      git clone https://github.com/jonasson2/voting
4. Install required packages:
      (cd vue-frontend && npm install)
      (cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt)
5. To run the simulator locally: (required )
      (cd vue-frontend && npm run build)
      (cd backend && python web.py)
      Direct a browser to `http://localhost:5000`


## Command Line Interface

This is the basic interaction mode. To set it up follow steps 1–5a above. You feed it some data files, it feeds you some results.

For help, try:
```
python cli.py --help
```

A few usage examples follow below.

### Apportionment

Basic apportioning is done through the `apportion` command. For help with that command, do:
```
python cli.py apportion --help
```
The `apportion` command takes several flags, including:

 * *constituencies*: path to a CSV or XLSX file describing constituencies.
 * *votes*: path to a CSV or XLSX file containing votes.
 * *divider*: the name of a supported divider method.
 * *adjustment-divider*: a supported divider method to use for adjustment seats; defaults to the same as the selected divider method.
 * *adjustment-method*: a supported adjustment method to use for resolving adjustment seat apportionment. Use multiple times to compare outputs.
 * *output*: the output format to use.
 * *show-entropy*: show the calculated entropy of each method.

Example using the 2013 elections in Iceland and d'Hondt method:
```
python cli.py apportion \
	--constituencies=../data/constituencies/constituencies_iceland_2013.csv \
	--votes=../data/elections/iceland_landskjorstjorn_2013.csv \
	--divider=dhondt \
	--adjustment-method=alternating-scaling \
	--show-entropy
```

You can get HTML, LaTeX, MediaWiki or various other types of table output and swap out the divider methods as you please:
```
python cli.py apportion \
	--constituencies=../data/constituencies/constituencies_iceland_2013.csv \
	--votes=../data/elections/iceland_landskjorstjorn_2013.csv \
	--divider=sainte-lague \
    --adjustment-method=monge \
	--output=html
```

### Simulation

Simulation is done through the `simulate` command. For help with that command, do:
```
python cli.py simulate --help
```
The `simulate` command takes several flags, including:

 * *constituencies*: path to a CSV or XLSX file describing constituencies.
 * *votes*: path to a CSV or XLSX file containing votes to use as reference for the simulation.
 * *test_method*: the method to be tested.
 * *num_sim*: number of simulations to run.
 * *gen_method*: a supported method to generate votes.

 Example using the 2013 elections in Iceland:
```
python cli.py simulate \
	--constituencies=../data/constituencies/constituencies_iceland_2013.csv \
	--votes=../data/elections/iceland_landskjorstjorn_2013.csv \
	--test_method=ice_law_dhondt
```

### Script mode

Because all the parameters can be confusing and sometimes you just want
to be able to work with a particular set of settings again and again,
there is a "script mode" (for lack of a better term) which allows you to
specify a set of rules which then execute:

```
python cli.py script ../data/presets/iceland2013.json
```

A script or preset is simply a JSON file that specifies what should
happen, see examples in `data/presets/`.


### Design

The web interface involves a Javascript Single Page App (SPA) which acts as a
visual editor for data that is then passed to the backend for calculations. As
such, the SPA is the source of truth, and the backend is "dumb", merely reacting
to the frontend. The backend is made with Flask.

The SPA's data model should be the same as the backend's script-mode input model.

The SPA is built using vue.js.
